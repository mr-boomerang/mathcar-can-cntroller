Hi!!!
 First go through 'Installtion.txt', 'Readme.txt' and 'Usage.txt' to know how to setup can and its associated modules on the system and run MLC.
 All the below assumes that can is setup on the PC properly and gateway CAN  is switched ON. If you have not done this I suggest that you read 'Installtion.txt' first.
 Please note the following four conditions for CAN to work.
 1. Neutral Gear in Car
 2. No handbrake engaged
 3. No brake Pressed nor any of the emergency switches.
 4. CAN connected to gateway securely and gateway powered on.

Then the checklist below is to be followed:
1. 'can0' listed as channel in settings.cfg
2. start roscore
3. Run the controller from the scripts folder
$ ./start_script_mlc.sh
There are 3 scripts
start controller  -> start_script_mlc.sh
start controller with Dataplotter -> start_script_mlc_with_dataplotter.sh
start controller with keyboard control -> start_script_mlc_with_keyboard.sh
4. Report any issues.
